Question I have searched tooo many time but never learnt
One -> Splitting a string by whitespace
String textStr[] = yourString.split("\\s+");

You need to investigate Lists.newArrayList vs new ArrayLists<String>
--> Something about overloading the constructor 
--> and dealing with generic types 

 -> lamba on int[] to sum of
 int sum = Arrays.stream(queue).reduce(0, Integer::sum);
